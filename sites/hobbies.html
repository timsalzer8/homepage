        <p>I'm glad you've decided to spend a bit more time on my website.</p>

        <p>Besides my newfound passion for programming,
           there are many other things that matter to me in life.
           In my free time, I love being creative, challenging myself with games,
           or just spending time with friends and family.</p>

        <p>On this page, I'd like to give you a little insight into my hobbies,
           and maybe you'll even discover something we have in common!</p><br>

                        <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong><br>
                        This strategic card game has captivated me for years.
                        I love the complex mechanics, creative deck building,
                        and the social aspect of playing with friends.

                    <strong>Board Games</strong><br>
                    Whether it's cooperative or competitive, board games
                    bring people together. They challenge my thinking and are always
                    a great excuse for a fun evening.

                    <strong>Videogames</strong><br>
                    I grew up with video games and still enjoy diving into new worlds.
                    From new titles to my personal evergreens,
                    I appreciate the storytelling, design, and challenges they offer.

                    <strong>Travelling</strong><br>
                    Exploring other cultures and landscapes gives
                    me a fresh perspective on life. Southeast Asia especially has a special
                    place in my heart for its people, food, and beauty.

                    <strong>Cooking</strong><br>
                    Trying out new recipes and perfecting favorite dishes is something
                    I truly enjoy. Cooking helps me unwind and get creative,
                    especially when I'm cooking for others.
